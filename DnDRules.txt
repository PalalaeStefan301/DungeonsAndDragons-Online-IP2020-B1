Attack Roll: When you make an attack, your attack roll determines

If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the
target’s Armor Class (AC), the attack hits.

Combat: 

2. Establish positions. The DM decides where all the
characters and monsters are located. Given the
adventurers’ marching order or their stated positions in
the room or other location, the DM figures out where the
adversaries are— how far away and in what direction.
3. Roll initiative. Everyone involved in the combat encounter
rolls initiative, determining the order of combatants’ turns.
4. Take turns. Each participant in the battle takes a turn in
initiative order. 
-you can move a distance up to your speed
and take one action
5. Begin the next round. When everyone involved in the
combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 until
the fighting stops.

Level up:

Experience points => Level up 
Each time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit Die. Roll that Hit Die, add your Constitution modifier to the roll, and add the total to your hit point maximum.
When your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained.
